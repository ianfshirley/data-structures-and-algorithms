# Kth from End
Using the LinkedList class we built for code challenge 5, create a new method to return the value of the node that
is 'k' nodes back from the end of the list.

## Whiteboard Process
![kth from end](kth_from_end.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
Traverse through the linked list to find the length. Traverse through the nodes in the list again, length - 'k' times.
Return the value of the node that is 'k' nodes back from the end of the list.
