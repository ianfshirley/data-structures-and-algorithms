  - Arguments: string
  - Return: string

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
- Time:  O(n) where n is the number of words in the string - worst case scenario, it will need to loop through each word in the string
- Space: O(n) where n is the number of words in the string - weâ€™re creating a set to hold each word until we find a duplicate. Worst case scenario the set will have to hold every word except the last one
